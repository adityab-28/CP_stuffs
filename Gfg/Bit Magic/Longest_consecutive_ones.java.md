Given a number `N`. Find the length of the longest consecutive 1's in its binary representation.

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 14
Output: 3
Explanation: Binary representation of 14 is 1110, in which 111 is the longest consecutive set bits of length is 3.
 ```

Example 2:

```
Input: N = 222
Output:	4
Explanation:
 Binary representation of 222 is 
 11011110, in which 1111 is the 
 longest consecutive set bits of length 4. 
```

**Task:**<br> 
	To complete the function `maxConsecutiveOnes()` which `returns` the `length` of the longest consecutive 1(s) in the binary representation of given `N`.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).**

**Constraints:**<br>
- 1 <= N <= 10<sup>6</sup>


> **Java Solution Code**

```JAVA
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Solution{
    
    /*  Function to calculate the longest consecutive ones
    *   N: given input to calculate the longest consecutive ones
    */
    public static int maxConsecutiveOnes(int N) {
        
        // Your code here
        int count = 0;
        while(N!=0){
            N = N&(N<<1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

class Main {
    
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();//testcases
		while(t-->0){
		    int n = sc.nextInt();//input n
		    
		    Solution obj = new Solution();
		    
		    //calling maxConsecutiveOnes() function
		    System.out.println(obj.maxConsecutiveOnes(n));
		}
	}
}
```

> ***Comments:***
<em>
The idea is based on the concept that if we AND a bit sequence with a left shifted version of itself, weâ€™re effectively removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.

So the operation N = (N & (N << 1)) reduces length of every sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of N. 
If we keep doing this operation in a loop, we end up with N = 0. The number of iterations required to reach 0 is actually length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s.
