Given a number N. Find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 14
Output: 3
Explanation: Binary representation of 14 is 1110, in which 111 is the longest consecutive set bits of length is 3.
 ```

Example 2:

<div><pre><code>
Input: N = 222<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> 4<br>
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Binary representation of 222 is 
11011110, in which 1111 is the 
longest consecutive set bits of length 4. 
</code></pre>
</div>

**Task:**<br> 
	To complete the function maxConsecutiveOnes() which returns the length of the longest consecutive 1(s) in the binary representation of given N. N<sup>2</sup>.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).**

**Constraints:**<br>
- 1 <= N <= 106


> **Java Solution Code**
```
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

class Solution{
    
    /*  Function to calculate the longest consecutive ones
    *   N: given input to calculate the longest consecutive ones
    */
    public static int maxConsecutiveOnes(int N) {
        
        // Your code here
        int count = 0;
        while(N!=0){
            N = N&(N<<1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

class Main {
    
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int t = sc.nextInt();//testcases
		while(t-->0){
		    int n = sc.nextInt();//input n
		    
		    Solution obj = new Solution();
		    
		    //calling maxConsecutiveOnes() function
		    System.out.println(obj.maxConsecutiveOnes(n));
		}
	}
}

             The idea is based on the concept that if we AND a bit sequence with a left shifted version of itself,
             weâ€™re effectively removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.
             
                  11101111   (N)
                & 11011110   (N << 1)
                ---------- 
                  11001110   (N & (N << 1))
                    ^    ^      
                    |    |
               trailing 1 removed
               
            So the operation N = (N & (N << 1)) reduces length of every sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of N.
            If we keep doing this operation in a loop, we end up with N = 0.
            The number of iterations required to reach 0 is actually length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s.
